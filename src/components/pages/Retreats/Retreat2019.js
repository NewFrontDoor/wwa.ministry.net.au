                        We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19) so we learn love by looking at God’s love and we see God’s love lived out by Jesus. But loving God and loving like Jesus doesn’t come naturally to us. To love like that, we need to “be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God” (Ephesians 3:19b) and if we could love like that, most of the world’s problems would disappear.

                        This year we're delving into the topic Loving God, Loving Others and grappling with questions of<br /><br />
                        How does God love us?<br />
                        How do we love people in our lives?<br />
                        What is it that holds us back from loving others as God commands?<br /><br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This year we are delighted to welcome Kathy Thurston as our main speaker <br />
                        We're also offering optional electives on Saturday afternoon for those who want to go deeper.<br />
                        However we also want this weekend to be a time where you can relax and recharge, so why not use the free time to take a walk along the beautiful beach at Camp Clayton or take part in a pilates session.

                    <h4>Kathy Thurston</h4>

                    <p className="speaker-bio">
                        Kathy is originally from Sydney and is the place where her adult children live and where her parish ministry and legal work was. However the last 2 years have brought many changes for Kathy when God called her and her husband Dave to move to Brisbane to work with a new ministry called <em><a href="https://church2church.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church2Church</a></em>.
            <br /><br />
                        Looking back over the last few years Kathy believes that <em>God has been preparing us for this new role</em> which involved ministering to clergy couples through mentoring and providing additional support through great resources and church consultancy.
            <br /><br />
                        Home is where the heart is, and despite missing her family Kathy’s move to Brisbane has still included a lot of things she enjoys like seeing different parts of Australia, meeting new people, reading great books, listening to music and in particular, talking to people about Jesus.
            <br /><br />
                        In recent years God has been teaching Kathy that knowing him is what life is all about and we learn that by exploring how wide and long and high and deep God’s love is for us in Jesus.

                                <p>It's a topic we've all had to grapple with at least once in our life. If women are given the task to help, what are the implications for work in the home and outside employment? What does this mean if you are single, married or widowed? In this elective, Karen will be gently addressing these questions in light of the Gospel.</p>

                                <p>Women have been at the fore of bringing the good news of Jesus to his people since the resurrection.

                        We're excited this year to be able to offer you an optional pilates session with Bec Wilcher, a local Hobart Physio. If you're interested in joining in you will need to bring an exercise mat. No prior experience required, all ages and physical abilities welcome - the only prerequisite is that you're able to get down and up from the floor.
