                            <p>Kylie has a love of learning, people and beauty. She is married to Peter with four wonderfully diverse children and is a counsellor through the <a href="http://www.dalbyhope.org/">Dalby Hope Centre.</a></p>
                            <p>Kylie discovered after being a Christian for thirty years, that the God she thought she knew was not the God of the Bible, that she only had half the story. She discovered that she had created a god through her life experiences that formed a filter, limiting her relationship with God in understanding his character and attributes, a god in her own image.</p>
                            <p>Kylie enjoys vegetable gardening in cool weather and finding little ways to live a bit differently.</p>
