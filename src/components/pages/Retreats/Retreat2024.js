								Carmelina and her husband Jeff have been in ministry together at Chatswood Presbyterian Church, where
								Jeff is the senior minister, for almost 25 years. They have 3 adult boys, a 16 year old daughter and a
								lovely new daughter in law. Carmi is the Dean of Women at Christ College, the Presbyterian Theological
								College in Sydney where she runs the Ministry Training for Women course and heads up the pastoral care
								of female students and candidates wives. In February this year, Carmi started a new role as a police
								chaplain at her local station. On a day off, Carmi loves going to the beach, reading crime novels set in
								Italy and going on a walk with her 2 dogs. At church, one of the highlights of her week is the women’s
								Bible study ministry on Wednesday mornings where she loves to see God’s word bring women into the
								kingdom and grow them in their faith in Christ.

						<h3>
							This years theme is <em>Waiting for the Day</em>
						</h3>

						<p className="retreat-text">
							<p>
								The book of 2 Thessalonians is just as relevant today as it was when it was written in the first
								century. The apostle Paul teaches us how we should live and work as we wait for Jesus to come back.
							</p>

							<p>
								Join us for a weekend of encouragement and challenge as we learn more about what will happen when Jesus
								comes back and the practical impact this has on our day-to-day life.
