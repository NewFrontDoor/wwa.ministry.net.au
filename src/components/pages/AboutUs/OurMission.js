				Women's Weekend Away is a weekend retreat for women to gather together for a time of biblical teaching, worship
				and friendship. This weekend away is open to all women, from 16 years and up.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Our hope and prayer is that this weekend away is a chance for you to to step away from the frantic pace of life
				and to simply soak in God’s word. We want this to be a time of spiritual, physical and emotional rest.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				We also want to model Titus 2, so there’s plenty of opportunity across the weekend to chat with other women as
				we each grapple with applying the bible to our own lives. The wisdom of older women is an encouragement in and
				of itself, and there’s so much to gain as we learn together as women of all ages, from different churches and
				walks of life.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				We often don’t get a chance to still our hearts and ask What is God saying to me in this season of life. But we
				know that sound biblical teaching (theology) leads to the praise of God (doxology). That right thinking leads to
				right desires which leads to right actions; head to heart to hands.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Located at Tamar Valley Resort, Grindewald just outside of Launcetson, Tasmania, this weekend away is a chance
				to hear some excellent teaching, invest in friendships, enjoy some good food and to set aside time to connect
				with God.
